# Progress Report — 2025-12-17

## Alignment Generation Fixes

- Fixed cached generation flow to auto-load cached JSONL files and proceed into dual view.
- Improved JSONL parsing to handle cached JSON strings and skip invalid alignment entries.
- Made task tracking resilient to dev reloads by storing tasks on `globalThis`.
- Stabilized Python pipeline execution (repo-local paths, remove original PDFs before markdown conversion).
- Improved JSON extraction from Python stdout for generation results.

## Notes

- Cached JSONL files are now stored with correct mime type and raw content.
- Drive-based cached generation now triggers alignment upload automatically.

**Status**: Generation and cached flow operational in dev.
