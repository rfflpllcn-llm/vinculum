# Acceptance Tests

## Anchors

- Anchors reopen on correct page ±2px  
- Deleting a note does not delete the anchor

## Sync scroll

- Scrolling source moves target within 20px  
- Manual scroll temporarily overrides sync

## AI audit

- AI input contains only aligned text  
- Output references anchorIds  
- No output if no alignment exists

## Persistence

- Reloading app restores library, notes, and alignments
